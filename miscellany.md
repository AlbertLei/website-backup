  - I think I have spent too much time on choosing a Beamer template. To avoid wasting more time in the future, I would commit to the following rules for Beamer presentation.

    - Use `Boadilla` with some modifications (delete footline except frame number, number the theorems, add section frames and so on): [example](https://github.com/AlbertLei/albertlei.github.io/blob/master/code/beamer-template.tex).
  
    - Use `Hannover` only when it is necessary to include TOC in each frame.
